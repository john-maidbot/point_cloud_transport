* \brief Allocator function that should allocate a buffer of the given size on the caller
side and return a pointer
 *        to it.
 *
 * This is used throughout the C API to ease returning strings and byte buffers of dynamic
size to the caller. Instead
 * of taking a writable `char*` argument or returning a `new`-allocated `const char*`,
the function takes the allocator
 * as the argument. When it is about to return to the caller, it uses the allocator to get a
caller-side-managed buffer
 * of the correct size and writes the string/byte buffer to this buffer.
 *
 * cras_py_common provides the `BytesAllocator` and `StringAllocator` classes that can be
passed as this allocator
 * argument. Once the ctypes function call finishes, the caller can access `allocator.value`
to get the string or
 * buffer returned by the function.
